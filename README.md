I'm Li yuhao, 19 years old and from Shanxi province in China. Now, I'm a student in BIT majoring data science and big data technology.

### About me

I'm really interested in MATH during my senior high school, so when I graduated, I chose a major which has a close relationship with MATH-------data science and big data technology. Though I didn't learn about the programing before, I'm also enthusiastic about the Programing. So when I came in BIT, I began to study it hard, and I have got a lot of progress so for. I know that computer science is field that includes so many things, and there are infinite technologies, I'm interested about them and I will keep studying during my rest of life. I like to study all kinds of technologies, and I think this short semester is a good chance to study html/css/js, so I take the initiative to serve as the CTO, I believe I will leran a lot during this period of time. 

In addition, I like the Japan animation and badminton very much. They extremely lighten my life when I'm not studying. Watching animation or playing badminton is a good way to relax myself so that I can be more energrtic in the subsequent learning process.
